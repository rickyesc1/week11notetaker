## Motivation and Description

The motivation behind this bootcamp assignment was to take starter code that was given to us, and to build the back end and then connect it to the front end to create a Note-Taking application that was then deployed on Heroku. The point of the app besides it's note-taking capabilites was to showcase the use of express, and our knowledge of html and http API routes. You can see and use the deployed app here: (https://shrouded-plateau-85452.herokuapp.com/)
